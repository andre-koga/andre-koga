## Hey! I'm André Koga 👋

- 🇯🇵 こんにちは！古賀寛志です
- 🇧🇷 Oi! Me chamo André Koga

I'm currently getting a *Computer Science Bachelor's Degree* at Georgia Tech - GO JACKETS! 🐝

*Why CS?* As one of the most flexible and far-reaching majors, CS is the one true tool capable of achieving anything my mind can conceive. 

As Feynman famously said,

> "What I cannot create, I do not understand."
